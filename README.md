# SpringTestHeroku

Quick and dirty Spring boot application that I made to test deploying to Heroku.
I also needed to test the Security configuration in Spring, and how to server static content. Still have a lot od things to try..
Deploying to Heroku was very simple, and it only took a few minutes following their guide.
